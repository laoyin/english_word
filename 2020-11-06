in the beginning

in the beginning, human beings created a God who was the First Cause of all things and Ruler of heaven and earth. He was not represented by images and had to temple
or priests in his service.  He was too exalted for an inadequate human cult. Gradually he faded from the consciousness of his people. He had become so remote that
they decided that they did not want him any more. Eventually he was said to have disappeared.


Indeed, it seems that in the ancient world people believed that it was only by participating in this divine life that they would become truly human. Earthly life

was obviously fragile and overshadowed by mortality, but if men and women imitated the actions of the gods they would share to some degree their greater power and
effectiveness. 

Thus it was said that the gods had shown men how to build their cities and temples, which were mere copies of their own homes in the divine realm.  The sacred world
of th gods-as recounted in myth-was not just an ideal towards which men and women should aspire but was the prototype of human existence;

it was the original pattern or the archetype on which our life here below had been modelled.
